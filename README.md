# Statistical Analysis in Python
This notebook presents statistical analysis in Python. It includes bootstrapping, confidence interval, test-statistics (one-sided, two-sided, Type I and II Errors) A/B testing with z-test, t-test, f-test, chi-square tests and effect size. All these approaches are implemented in Python. Two realistic data are applied in this work: 1- 2008 US swing state election results from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aman1py/swing-states?resource=download), 2- Dimension of the finch beak data from [datadryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.g6g3h).
